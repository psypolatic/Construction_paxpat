#### Day 1
## A system is a group of parts working together to accomplish a goal. There are four basic parts of a systems model:
Inputs
Process
Outputs
Feedback

Input
Input is everything that goes into a system to make it work the way it should. In construction technology, input includes people who work on the building, information needed to construct the building, and equipment and tools used for construction.

Note
Input also includes materials to build the project, energy, and access to the project at the right time.

Processes
The process of how people build structures is divided into four parts: designing structures, managing construction, producing or building structures, and using structures. First, the building must be designed. Next, the construction project must be managed, from developing the schedule to hiring people to work at the site. Then, once the pre-planning is complete, the actual building process begins. Finally, the process is completed when people move into the finished building and start to use it.

Output
The output part of the process includes:
The newly built structure 
Any new techniques used, or lessons learned during its construction
The impact of the structure on the community, which could be positive or negative

Feedback
Feedback provides extremely valuable information because it lets people know how they're doing, and gives timely information so that what isn't working can be fixed. Feedback lets you measure how much time it takes to complete the installation of a unit of material. If your system is functioning correctly, you'll have high productivity on the construction site. If your system is malfunctioning, you'll experience delays, absenteeism, and low worker morale.

The construction process starts the moment an individual or a company decides to build or remodel a structure. The process involves everyone who dedicates time and money toward the completion of the project. This includes the architect, the structure's owner, the financing company, the suppliers, the general contractor, and the construction crews.
There are several decisions that must be made before a project even gets started. For instance, where should the structure be built? Who will build it? How long should the project take to complete? How much will it cost? 

Important issues to consider in the initial phase of the project are:
Selecting a site
Financing the venture
Preparing the plans

Selecting a Site
Why do you think gas stations are located along interstate highways? Why aren't schools built twenty miles outside of a town? Do you think it's a good idea to put factories near transportation routes? The first phase of construction is to determine where the building will be located. Location is important. If a building is in a convenient location, it serves society well. If a facility doesn't have easy accessibility, it makes life more difficult for the people who work there and for their suppliers and customers.

Obtaining Financing
Next, you have to obtain financing to pay for the building. Financing is a common practice in the construction industry. Usually, construction projects cost much more money than most individuals or corporations have on hand. For privately owned projects, like homes and office buildings, the owners borrow money from a bank and pay it back over a set amount of time. Publicly owned projects, like schools, parks, and highways, are often funded through taxes and bond elections.

Creating Blueprints
After financing is obtained, every detail of the project must be written down in a format that everyone involved can understand--from the type of brick to the brand of doorknobs. Architects record all final decisions on a set of project plans, called blueprints, that identify the details of the project.
You have the plans. Now where do you begin? Scheduling is a crucial part of the construction process. Construction crews specialize in different parts of the project, such as carpentry, electrical wiring, or plumbing. This creates scheduling dependencies, which means that one group can't start their portion of the building until a previous group has finished. Therefore, schedules must follow a logical sequence of events, including scheduling crews and delivering materials and equipment at the right time.

Note
Accurate scheduling is essential for the project to be completed on time and within budget.

Building the Project
Once the schedule is completed, the actual building process occurs from the ground up. As the various construction crews perform their tasks, the building begins to take shape. However, materials may not arrive on time, or bad weather may prevent crews from working. The schedule may need to be readjusted to account for s

#### Day 3

You might have heard about some famous Architects like Frank Lloyd Wright or Phillip Johnson. But what do architects really do? What are they responsible for, and how are they involved with construction?

The building process doesn't begin on the first day of construction. Important decisions need to be made long before ground is broken on a site. First, an Architect designs and draws the building. 

The architect discusses plans with the owner and decides how the structure will be used, what it will look like, and which materials will be selected.
**How does the architect communicate what the building should look like? How do construction crews know what to build? The answer to both of these questions is that the architect creates a set of plans called drawings. Detailed drawings show the appearance of the completed building.**

Architects need to use a standardized system of symbols to represent walls, windows, and even sinks and chairs. With this system, everyone involved in the process sees, reads, and speaks about the same items using the same terms.

These symbols and abbreviations are part of the standards set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Some examples of items represented by symbols are:
Doors
Windows
Sinks
Toilets
Architects may use different methods to produce drawings, based on which schools they attended and how they were taught. Some architects use computer-aided design, or CAD, very early in the design process.

Other architects prefer to produce the conceptual, or initial, drawings by hand, then input the design into a computer later in the design process. Either way, there are distinct advantages to using CAD software at some point.

## CAD Software

CAD software is special software designed to help architects and construction professionals save time. For instance, CAD can perform time-intensive calculations automatically. Also, CAD designs can be changed or revised easily, eliminating the need to completely redraw them by hand. Designs can be created in layers and used in several ways during a project design. Yet CAD software does have a few disadvantages, including the initial expense and the time required to learn to use it efficiently.
Architects use two methods to show what a building will look like when it's finished: pictorial and multi-view drawings.

Pictorial drawings, usually drawn in color, represent how the building and landscape will look from one vantage point, or perspective. A multi-view drawing displays various views of the building, including the front, top, and one side.
What would happen if construction crews were given only a pictorial drawing? They wouldn't have any idea how to construct the actual building. Construction crews need detailed plans. Typically, there are three different ways to provide explicit details to the construction crew. They are: 
## Plan view
Section view
Elevation view

Note
> A floor plan shows the location and size of all walls, doors, and windows in the building. Each floor of the building has its own floor plan.

## Section View
To visualize a section view, imagine cutting a slice of a layer cake. After you take out the slice, you can see a cross-section of the cake's contents. A section view of a building shows how all the floors of the building relate to each other.

Note
> Section views make it easy to see how stairs, vents, plumbing, and electrical wiring fit together on each floor of the building.

## Elevation View
To picture the elevation view of a building, imagine that you were walking around the building photographing it. An elevation drawing shows the exterior of all sides of a building. Elevation views provide carpenters with information about floor levels, grade lines, window and door heights, and roof slopes. An elevation view also shows the different materials to be used, such as roofing surfaces and window trim.

Although the architect provides several views and many details on the drawings, it's impossible to include everything. Sometimes, it's easier to explain certain types of information in writing. The construction specifications, or "specs," are written documents that tell the contractor which materials to use. For example, the specs may list the grade, or quality, of lumber to use for custom cabinets.

Specification writers must be detail-oriented and have a thorough knowledge of building codes and other construction regulations.


#### Day 4

### Blueprints
As you recall, architects create an original scaled drawing that incorporates all the information the construction crews will use. Copies of these original drawings are called blueprints. 

There are several parts to a blueprint. Architects supply construction crews with sets of plans that lay out how the building will be built from the ground up. These plans include:
A plot plan
A foundation or basement plan
Floor plans
Elevation drawings
Framing plans
Drawings of the electrical, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning layouts
The scale that was used to create the drawings
## Plot Plan
You use a plot plan, or site plan, to determine exactly where to place the structure on the property. The plot plan includes the location of the building in relation to the property line, the trees that you want to remain on the lot, and the finished grade. The finished grade is the site's elevation above sea level when the project is finished. The plot plan also shows the drainage of the area around the building and any easements, which are areas that can't be built upon.
## Foundation Plan
Since the foundation supports the weight of the entire structure, it's crucial that it be built correctly. If the foundation isn't strong and rigid, the building could flex or crack. The foundation plan shows how it should be laid out, as well as any special considerations that go into the foundation, such as a basement with windows. The plan will show whether any support bars are needed and, if so, where to place them.
## Framing plans
 Framing plans detail how to build the interior and exterior walls of the structure. The plan provides special detailed drawings for the load-bearing walls that support the structure. Framing plans also show the details for the flooring, ceilings, roof, and the placement of stairs.
## Other Layouts
 The electrical, plumbing, and heating and air conditioning layouts often have their own plans. In some cases, they're included as part of another plan. Therefore, it's important to study all the plans thoroughly
 
 ### General Contractor
 The General Contractor, or GC for short, is responsible for the overall construction of the project. Project delays cost money. Therefore, it's the GC's responsibility to make sure the job is completed on time.

In smaller companies, the general contractor is closely involved in the daily project details, such as determining when materials should be delivered to the site and how long each part of the construction process should last. In larger companies, the general contractor pays the bills and deals with owners, but isn't directly involved in the daily activities of the project..

### Superintendent
The superintendent's job on most construction sites is to supervise the subcontractors or job crews. The "super" also makes sure that the day-to-day job activities run smoothly. If a problem arises at the building site, it's the superintendent's job to find a way to resolve it.

The superintendent is hired by the general contractor and usually works out of a construction trailer located on or near the site.

### Subcontractors & Labor Force
## Subcontractors
 A contractor doesn't have the staff to perform each phase of the job. So subcontractors are hired to perform specific tasks. Since subcontractors specialize in particular construction tasks, there are usually many different subcontractors involved in the construction process.

For example, a contractor may need a backhoe operator to excavate for the foundation, a mason to lay tile floors, and a welder to bolt and weld girders 30 stories in the air. The subcontractor may work alone or may direct a crew of several people to complete the job.
## labor force
 Laborers do all of the supportive tasks at a construction site. They perform a lot of hard physical work; they dig, shovel, and do most of the cleanup. The work they do is vital to the construction team. Laborers are not considered tradespeople, although many of them are in training to become tradespeople.

# day 5
As you recall, the building process is similar for all types of construction, although large civil and industrial projects involve more sophisticated techniques and machinery. We're going to examine how the residential construction process works by building a house from the ground up.

Keep in mind that the process can vary from project to project. Yet the construction of even a simple residence requires many steps. The superintendent must pay close attention to the schedule to prevent things like weather and late delivery of materials from delaying the project.
Before any project is constructed, the actual building site has to be prepared to achieve a level contour. To do this, contractors use topographical drawings. Such drawings are plan views that show the shape of the land, as well as other important geographical features like roads, buildings, and trees.

The point between a hilltop and the bottom of the hill is very different in elevation. 

To measure the difference between the two points, Surveyors take photographs with a stereoscopic instrument. Then, they create topographical drawings based on the photographs and their surveyor's notes.

On a topographical drawing, a contour line shows the elevation in feet above sea level. Two contour lines show the difference in elevation between two areas. The line that indicates the difference between the two points on a drawing is called the vertical contour interval.

The plot plan establishes the setback, which is the distance from the front of the house to the street. The contractor uses stakes to mark the front of the house. Then, a builder's level or transit is used to lay out the other corners of the building.

A builder's level and a transit are tools that allow the builder to check the level from one corner to another corner of the building. The builder's level uses a target rod, which is a measuring device with a scale graduated in inches and fractions of an inch. The builder's level sits over a corner stake. Then, it's focused on the target rod held at the other corner stake.

Note
Using a transit is slightly different because the viewing lens on the transit focuses vertically up or down to read the angles.
Batter Boards
Batter boards are used to show the excavation and foundation crews where the building's exterior walls will be. They're constructed about five feet outside each corner of the building so they won't interfere with any excavation or trenching activities.

First, wooden stakes are driven into the ground and crosspieces are nailed to them. Next, lines are strung across the corner stakes to mark the building lines. Finally, the contractor suspends a plumb bob over the stake to check the accuracy of the building line before marking the batter board.

Before it's time to build the base of the building, or foundation, the soil must be prepared. Different types of building foundations are used in different regions, according to the soil, drainage, and weather conditions. Excavators use heavy equipment at the site to level the lot, dig a foundation or trench, or excavate for a basement. The weight of a building must be supported by the soil that is beneath it.

Finally, the excavator grades, or smoothes out, the land surrounding the building lines to a rough grade. The rough grade leaves the dirt a few inches lower than the finished grade so that there is room for topsoil. The surveyor marks the grade stakes to show the excavator the correct level. In some situations, low spots must be raised with "fill" dirt. Other times, higher areas must be shaved off, or "cut."
