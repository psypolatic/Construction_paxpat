### Day 1
## A system is a group of parts working together to accomplish a goal. There are four basic parts of a systems model:
Inputs
Process
Outputs
Feedback

Input
Input is everything that goes into a system to make it work the way it should. In construction technology, input includes people who work on the building, information needed to construct the building, and equipment and tools used for construction.

Note
Input also includes materials to build the project, energy, and access to the project at the right time.

Processes
The process of how people build structures is divided into four parts: designing structures, managing construction, producing or building structures, and using structures. First, the building must be designed. Next, the construction project must be managed, from developing the schedule to hiring people to work at the site. Then, once the pre-planning is complete, the actual building process begins. Finally, the process is completed when people move into the finished building and start to use it.

Output
The output part of the process includes:
The newly built structure 
Any new techniques used, or lessons learned during its construction
The impact of the structure on the community, which could be positive or negative

Feedback
Feedback provides extremely valuable information because it lets people know how they're doing, and gives timely information so that what isn't working can be fixed. Feedback lets you measure how much time it takes to complete the installation of a unit of material. If your system is functioning correctly, you'll have high productivity on the construction site. If your system is malfunctioning, you'll experience delays, absenteeism, and low worker morale.

The construction process starts the moment an individual or a company decides to build or remodel a structure. The process involves everyone who dedicates time and money toward the completion of the project. This includes the architect, the structure's owner, the financing company, the suppliers, the general contractor, and the construction crews.
There are several decisions that must be made before a project even gets started. For instance, where should the structure be built? Who will build it? How long should the project take to complete? How much will it cost? 

Important issues to consider in the initial phase of the project are:
Selecting a site
Financing the venture
Preparing the plans

Selecting a Site
Why do you think gas stations are located along interstate highways? Why aren't schools built twenty miles outside of a town? Do you think it's a good idea to put factories near transportation routes? The first phase of construction is to determine where the building will be located. Location is important. If a building is in a convenient location, it serves society well. If a facility doesn't have easy accessibility, it makes life more difficult for the people who work there and for their suppliers and customers.

Obtaining Financing
Next, you have to obtain financing to pay for the building. Financing is a common practice in the construction industry. Usually, construction projects cost much more money than most individuals or corporations have on hand. For privately owned projects, like homes and office buildings, the owners borrow money from a bank and pay it back over a set amount of time. Publicly owned projects, like schools, parks, and highways, are often funded through taxes and bond elections.

Creating Blueprints
After financing is obtained, every detail of the project must be written down in a format that everyone involved can understand--from the type of brick to the brand of doorknobs. Architects record all final decisions on a set of project plans, called blueprints, that identify the details of the project.
You have the plans. Now where do you begin? Scheduling is a crucial part of the construction process. Construction crews specialize in different parts of the project, such as carpentry, electrical wiring, or plumbing. This creates scheduling dependencies, which means that one group can't start their portion of the building until a previous group has finished. Therefore, schedules must follow a logical sequence of events, including scheduling crews and delivering materials and equipment at the right time.

Accurate scheduling is essential for the project to be completed on time and within budget.

Building the Project
Once the schedule is completed, the actual building process occurs from the ground up. As the various construction crews perform their tasks, the building begins to take shape. However, materials may not arrive on time, or bad weather may prevent crews from working. The schedule may need to be readjusted to account for s

### Day 3

You might have heard about some famous Architects like Frank Lloyd Wright or Phillip Johnson. But what do architects really do? What are they responsible for, and how are they involved with construction?

The building process doesn't begin on the first day of construction. Important decisions need to be made long before ground is broken on a site. First, an Architect designs and draws the building. 

The architect discusses plans with the owner and decides how the structure will be used, what it will look like, and which materials will be selected.
**How does the architect communicate what the building should look like? How do construction crews know what to build? The answer to both of these questions is that the architect creates a set of plans called drawings. Detailed drawings show the appearance of the completed building.**

Architects need to use a standardized system of symbols to represent walls, windows, and even sinks and chairs. With this system, everyone involved in the process sees, reads, and speaks about the same items using the same terms.

These symbols and abbreviations are part of the standards set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Some examples of items represented by symbols are:
Doors
Windows
Sinks
Toilets
Architects may use different methods to produce drawings, based on which schools they attended and how they were taught. Some architects use computer-aided design, or CAD, very early in the design process.

Other architects prefer to produce the conceptual, or initial, drawings by hand, then input the design into a computer later in the design process. Either way, there are distinct advantages to using CAD software at some point.
CAD software is special software designed to help architects and construction professionals save time. For instance, CAD can perform time-intensive calculations automatically. Also, CAD designs can be changed or revised easily, eliminating the need to completely redraw them by hand. Designs can be created in layers and used in several ways during a project design. Yet CAD software does have a few disadvantages, including the initial expense and the time required to learn to use it efficiently.
Architects use two methods to show what a building will look like when it's finished: pictorial and multi-view drawings.

Pictorial drawings, usually drawn in color, represent how the building and landscape will look from one vantage point, or perspective. A multi-view drawing displays various views of the building, including the front, top, and one side.
What would happen if construction crews were given only a pictorial drawing? They wouldn't have any idea how to construct the actual building. Construction crews need detailed plans. Typically, there are three different ways to provide explicit details to the construction crew. They are: 
Plan view
Section view

> A floor plan shows the location and size of all walls, doors, and windows in the building. Each floor of the building has its own floor plan.

### Section View
To visualize a section view, imagine cutting a slice of a layer cake. After you take out the slice, you can see a cross-section of the cake's contents. A section view of a building shows how all the floors of the building relate to each other.

Section views make it easy to see how stairs, vents, plumbing, and electrical wiring fit together on each floor of the building.
